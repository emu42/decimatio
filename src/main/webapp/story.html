  <h1>Welcome to the Roman Legion!</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><img
src="Intro_files/image001.png" align=left hspace=12>After a relentless battle
against the proud kingdom of Gamebertia, you find yourself unable to conquer
their heavily guarded fortress. You were about to rise in the ranks, as your
majestic blue garment signals. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><img
src="Intro_files/image002.png" align=right hspace=12>The other legionnaires,
wearing white garments, were looking up to you, hoping you would lead them to
victory. Seeing that the situation is hopeless, you decide to turn around and
go back home. As a consequence, you and your troops have to face your punishment:</p>

<h1>DECIMATIO !</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><img
src="Intro_files/image003.png" align=left hspace=12>You feel sorry for the
other legionnaires, except for one of them. The man rivalling you in getting
the promotion you’ve been longing for. You cannot stand him and he smells a
little. Probably the reason his clothes yellowed a bit. Of course, he enjoys
every moment of letting you know what a failure of a mission you were leading.
You wouldn’t mind this guy falling victim to the punishment. There is no
escape.</p>
